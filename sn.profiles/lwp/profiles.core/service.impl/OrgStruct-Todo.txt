This details how to retrieve the manager in a single query.

In order for this to work correctly, we need to create a PROF_MANAGER_LOWER column.  
When executing, one of the criterial would need to be max_level to prevent looping. 
We really need a MANGER_LOWER column anyways to properly construct the org info chart.

Alternatively, we could make the 'select' a 'select distinct' with out the 'LEVEL' criteria.  This would prevent duplicates / loops also. 


with OrgStruct (PROF_UID, PROF_MANAGER_UID, LEVEL) as
(
select PROF_UID, PROF_MANAGER_UID, 0
  from EMPINST.EMPLOYEE where PROF_MAIL_LOWER = 'ahernm@us.ibm.com'
union all 
select A.PROF_UID, B.PROF_MANAGER_UID, A.LEVEL + 1
  from OrgStruct A, EMPINST.EMPLOYEE B
  where A.PROF_MANAGER_UID = B.PROF_UID 
)
select * from OrgStruct
