warning.init.startupBean=CLFRN1202W: An error occurred while initializing the Platform Command processor. See nested exception for more details. 
info.worker.events.stats=CLFRN1199I: Profiles Worker processed {0} commands during this turn.
info.worker.event.processing=CLFRN1200I: Processing Platform Command Event with id {0} and name {1}.
info.worker.config.disabled=CLFRN1220I: Platform Command publication is disabled. No user synchronization data will be sent from Profiles to other applications (the property com.ibm.lconn.profiles.config.EnableUserDataPropagation is set to false). See the documentation for details. 
info.worker.config.enabled=CLFRN1226I: Platform Command publication is enabled. User synchronization data will be sent from Profiles to other applications.

# PhotoSyncTask is the name of the scheduled task; it should not be translated; {0} represents an integer
info.worker.sync.events.stats=CLFRN1343I: Profiles PhotoSyncTask synchronized {0} photos during this run.
error.photosync.failed.to.init=CLFRN1342E: Error initializing PhotoSyncTask. This error will prevent the Profiles application from synchronizing photo updates. The ''{0}'' environment variable is ''{1}''.

# ProfileSyncTask is the new name of the scheduled task; it should not be translated
# the following 3 stings are edited copies of the above 3 strings (which will become obsolete - to be removed later)
# {0} is the number of events that were processed (including any errors); {1)} is the number of profiles and {2} the number of photos that were sync'd
info.worker.profile.sync.events.stats=CLFRN1364I: Profiles ProfileSyncTask synchronized {0} items during this run. {1} profiles and {2} photos.
# {0} system name of an environment variable that should be set in the deployment; {1} is the value found in that variable
error.profile.sync.failed.to.init=CLFRN1363E: Error initializing ProfileSyncTask. This error will prevent the Profiles application from synchronizing profile updates. The ''{0}'' environment variable is ''{1}''.
# {0} is the ID of the user; {1} is the internal name of the event (not translated)
