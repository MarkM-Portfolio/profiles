This directory (/profiles.db.schemas/legacy) contains files that are required to build
and fixup schemas up to and including the v4.5 versions. The usage of msgvector/dynattr
tables in PEOPLEDB has decreased, but the "legacy" files are required to build historical 
versions of the schema.

The files in "legacy" are copied from /lc.appext.msgvector.db/database and 
lc.appext/dynattr/db.
