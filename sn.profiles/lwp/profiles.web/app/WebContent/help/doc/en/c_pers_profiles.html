<h1 class="title topictitle1">Viewing profiles</h1>
<div class="body conbody main"><p class="shortdesc">View profiles to find contact and work-related information
for people.</p>
<p class="p">In addition to contact details and work background, a profile provides
rich, social information about a person that can help you decide if
you want to connect with them. For example, you can see how you are
related to the person, the top things you have in common, their latest
status updates, and what they've been doing lately in the other
applications.</p>
<p class="p">View a person's profile to find the following information:</p>
<dl class="dl"><dt class="dt dlterm">The Board</dt>
<dd class="dd">The latest posts to the profile owner's board. This information
includes the profile owner's recent status messages and comments
that other users have posted to the profile owner's board.</dd>
<dt class="dt dlterm">Contact information</dt>
<dd class="dd">Typically found on a business card, such as name, job title, company,
location, telephone numbers, and e-mail addresses, the profile identifies
the person's local time, and, if applicable, an assistant's contact
information. Click the business card icon to export the person's contact
information as a virtual card file. A virtual card (vCard) is a file
that stores basic contact information following the Internet Mail
Consortium specification. You can add new contacts by using your e-mail
system to import vCard files.<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> Your administrator can configure IBM&reg; Lotus&reg; Connections to prevent e-mail addresses from being displayed,
in which case e-mail addresses do not display in a person's profile
or business card.</div>
When Sametime&reg; awareness is enabled, the person's online status
is displayed. The Lotus Connections
Plug-in for Sametime must
be installed for this information to display.</dd>
<dt class="dt dlterm">Background</dt>
<dd class="dd">Current&reg; work experience,
technical skills, languages spoken, interests, past work experience,
and education. This information is a rich-text field composed by the
profile owner and includes any information that the profile owner
wants to share.</dd>
<dt class="dt dlterm">Recent Posts</dt>
<dd class="dd">This section uses tabbed views to display the latest updates that
the profile owner has made to other Lotus Connections applications.</dd>
<dt class="dt dlterm">Pronunciation</dt>
<dd class="dd">The pronunciation link is displayed when the profile owner has
created an audio file and uploaded it to the profile. Click the link
to play a recording of the person's name with the correct pronunciation.</dd>
<dt class="dt dlterm">What connects us?</dt>
<dd class="dd">A list of the people that link you and the profile owner in Lotus Connections. Viewing the
information in the What Connects Us widget is a useful way to see
how you are connected to a particular person. For more information,
see <cite class="cite">Using the What Connects Us widget</cite>.<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> You must
be logged in to see information about the social path that exists
between you and the profile owner.</div>
</dd>
<dt class="dt dlterm">Reporting structure</dt>
<dd class="dd">Choose one of the following report-to chain view options:<div class="tablenoborder"><table cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="" class="table" rules="all" frame="border" border="1"><caption><span class="tablecap">Table 1.

</tbody>
</table>
</div>
</dd>
<dt class="dt dlterm">Profile tags</dt>
<dd class="dd">Short keywords used to identify the profile owner's skills, areas
of interest, or work activities. These tags can be added by the profile
owner or by another person.</dd>
<dt class="dt dlterm">Collaborative tools</dt>
<dd class="dd">When profiles are integrated with other collaborative tools, such
as IBM Lotus Sametime, you can see the profile owner's presence information
indicating whether the person is available to chat.</dd>
<dt class="dt dlterm">Network</dt>
<dd class="dd">This area shows a selection of the people in the profile owner's
network. You can click <span class="ph uicontrol">See all</span> to display a
list of everyone in the person's network.</dd>
