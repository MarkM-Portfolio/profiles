<h1 class="title topictitle1">Welcome to Profiles</h1>
<div class="body conbody main"><p class="shortdesc">Profiles provide a directory of the people in an organization:
how to contact them, and how to find out about their projects, skills,
and interests.</p>
<p class="p">Profiles facilitate collaboration by helping you to find and get
in touch with the right people fast.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Increase your visibility.</strong> Use profiles to let people in
the organization know who you are, what you do, what projects you
are working on, the tools and technologies you are using, the problems
you are currently trying to solve, and what you are reading or writing.
Start by filling out your profile. Help people get to know you better
by adding rich social information, such as your interests, hobbies,
and tags that indicate your area of expertise.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Become involved.</strong> Use profiles to discover who in the organization
is working on projects like yours or finding solutions to similar
problems, and what resources they are using to simplify their jobs.
Find out who your co-workers are, what their interests are, what skills
they have, what they are publishing or reading, and get in touch with
them. See who they connect to so that you can extend your network
further.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Build your own network.</strong> Use profiles to make useful connections.
Find people with the skills and expertise you need and add them to
your network. Follow people when you want to keep up with their updates
but don't want to add them to your network. You can view the
latest status updates from the people that you are following and the
people in your network by logging in to the Home page and selecting <span class="ph uicontrol">Status Updates</span> on the <span class="ph uicontrol">Updates</span> tab.</p>
<p class="p">Profiles can help you to tap into the collective knowledge of the
people in your organization and work collaboratively with others.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Accessing the Profiles feature</strong></p>
<p class="p">To log in to the Profiles feature, go to the Web site designated
as the feature home page by the administrator who configured the product.
Provide the user name and password created for you by the administrator.
If you want to give an additional person access to the feature, contact
your administrator; that person must first be added to the appropriate
user directory for the login to be successful.</p>
